Primary Skillset
Experince in any JS framework (Backbone, Angular, React or any other framework)


What is React?
    Framework for building UI applications for the browser



Server
    UI
    App Services
    Domain
    Repository (DAL)


Salary Calculator
    Assumption
        1. meets 100% functional requirements (No validations are needed)
        2. Another team will prepare the app for deployment


react.js
    => responsible for managing VDOM

react-dom.js
    => responsible for updating the browser DOM (using VDOM)


HTML vs JSX
================================
    HTML
        Open tags are closed (without corresponding close tags)
        "for" attribute is allowed
        "class" attribute is allowed

    JSX
        Every open tag must have a corresponding close tag
        Use 'htmlFor' in place of 'for' attribute
        Use 'className' in place of 'class' attribute

    Assignment:
        Array Methods
            forEach
            filter
            map
            reduce

        
    Function Invocation Patterns
        1. As a method of an obj
            this => obj

        2. As a function
            this => global scope (window)

        3. Using the 'call' method of the method
        4. Using the 'apply' method of the function
        5. As an 'Immediately Invoked Function Expression'
        6. Using the 'new' keyword


Class Vs. Function components
    Class
        Component objects need to be created
        All the lifecycle events will be executed irrespective whether they are used or not
        

    React Hooks
        functions using which we can handle sideeffects in a functional component
        all hook function names must start 'use'
        hook functions must be used only in a functional component
        builtin hooks
            - useState
            - useEffect
            - useRef
            - useMemo
            - useCallback
            - useContext
            - useReducer


State
    1. UI State
        Data that supports the presentation needs of the component
        It is highly UNLIKELY that this data is needed outside the component
        Suitable to maintain them in the component state

    2. Application State
        Data that supports the core application logic
        It is highly LIKELY that this data is needed outside the component
        DO NOT maintain this data in the component state


npm & yarn

to install yarn
    [sudo] npm install -g yarn

To create a react application

    npm install create-react-app -g
    create-react-app <app-name>

    OR
    
    npx create-react-app <app-name>

    OR

    yarn create react-app <app-name>

ES6 Modules
    Everything defined in a JS file is considered private
    Public entites have to be explicitly 'exported'
    Entites from other files have to be explicitly 'imported'


src
    bugs
        /actions
            addNew.js
            toggle.js
            remove.js
            removeClosed.js
            index.js (create the actionCreator by importing the actions from other files)
        /components
            BugStats.jsx
            BugSort.jsx
            BugEdit.jsx
            BugItem.jsx
            BugList.jsx
        /reducers
            bugsReducer.js
        index.js (main Bugs component)
        index.css
    store
        index.js

    index.js

Installing redux
    npm install redux
    OR
    yarn add redux


Assignment

Add a projects module to the bug-tracker-app

Use cases:
    1. Adding a project
    2. Listing the projects

store/index.js
    comment the bugsReducer
    instead use the projects reducer

index.js
    Commend everything related to bugs
    include the projects and make it work

react-redux
    adapter that connect react with redux

    connect
        given the storeState, extract the data for the component from the store state
        given the dispatch, create action dispatchers to be passed to the component

    Provider
        facilitates access to the storeState and dispatch to the 'connected' components

Container Components / Smart Components
    interface with redux infrastructure

Presentation Components / Dumb Components
    do not have any knowledge of the redux infrastructure
    receive the data from the parent component

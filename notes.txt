HTML vs JSX
================================
    HTML
        Open tags are closed (without corresponding close tags)
        "for" attribute is allowed
        "class" attribute is allowed

    JSX
        Every open tag must have a corresponding close tag
        Use 'htmlFor' in place of 'for' attribute
        Use 'className' in place of 'class' attribute
